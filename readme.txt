ASCII/Curses Othello in Python for Windows, Mac and Linux

I decided to learn Python.  I wanted a project to use as a base, so I chose
Othello.

The AI in this game is very simple, and thus not great.  It looks for the
most tiles it can take this turn, and it uses a structure that "backs" the 
board to make playing certain tiles have an advantage.  An "advantage" just
means the "number of pieces captured" by playing on that square is boosted
by some amount.  Perhaps later I will make a better evaluator.

V1.0 - 11 Jan 2017 - Initial Release - Windows only.
V1.1 - 12 Jan 2017 - Mac and Linux support.
V1.2 - 12 Jan 2017 - ESC brings up in-game menu.
V1.3 - 13 Jan 2017 - Added help and Undo/Redo. Made board look nicer.

If anyone reads the code and has comments, please let me know!  As I did
this to learn, I would love any feedback that helps me improve.
